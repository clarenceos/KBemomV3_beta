# Why This Exists

I got tired of paying subscriptions for something as simple as a timer.

Kettlebell EMOMs are one of the most effective training formats:
simple structure, measurable volume, and brutally effective conditioning.

This app focuses on doing one thing extremely well:

**A fast, reliable, kettlebell-focused EMOM timer that stays out of your way.**

No ads.
No subscriptions.
No analytics.
No accounts.

Just you, your kettlebell, and a timer that works.
